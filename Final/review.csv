It has explored using Finite-impulse response (FIR), Carry resists adder (CRA), and carry propagation adder (CPA) for IoT-based wireless sensor networks (WSN). The title mentioned CRABRA and it was illustrated in the results but not clarified in the abstract. It is suggested to add CRABRA experimentation to the abstract. In addition, the abstract shows many details about the results that can be simplified by showing only concluded remarks and having a comparative analysis in the discussion part. The results have been well-analyzed. However, the conclusion mentioned 'various current approaches are contrasted with the suggested CRABRAA methodology' is not in favor of the research and can not come to a conclusion.  Moreover, the conclusion mentioned the superiority of CRA over other methods which needs to be well stated. Kindly note that CRABRA is first mentioned in page 5 with no proper introduction or illustration earlier in the research.

In the simulations, it was discovered that the antenna gain increases when a cavity is used, although the axial ratio is slightly decreased.

The manuscript needs a major change in the content and format as it is not following the standards of a scientific paper. The authors need to carefully review the manuscript based on the comments below:

1. Roughly 85% of all cited works should be less than five years old. But All the references used in the manuscript are very old.
2. I suggest removing unnecessary refs. For example, the QHA impact on space applications does not need 7 refs. Please keep the ref that is related to the statement only.

18,1554,1,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The paper introduces and interesting comparative study between several ML algorithms to predict the turbulent hydrogen jet caused by hydrogen leakage in the air.

However, there are some comments that need to be addressed by the author.

1. In the introduction, change ""The relative effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting must be accurately estimated by decreasing various loss functions, namely squared errors."" to ""The relative effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting must be accurately estimated by decreasing various loss functions, (mainly) the squared errors.""

2. I believe that the statement ""An empirical-analytical-numerical model is used to build an artificial dataset."" is too complicated to be understood, unless justified or supported by a reference.

3. In the subsection ""A. Random Forest"", remove the repeated ""the"" from ""the The random forest ensemble learning technique may solve"" and add a period after the word ""ensemble"" in ""help of several decision trees working together as an ensemble,"".

4. I suggest rephrasing this ""Adding a portion of the previous weight change to the current weight change is employed to smooth out the optimization process."" in the subsection ""B. Artificial Neural Networks"".

5. Write ""Mean-absolute error (MAE), R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are the assessment metrics used to assess machine learning models."" instead of ""Mean-absolute error (MAE), R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean square error are the assessment metrics
used to assess machine learning models (RMSE)."".

6. It is better to use the abbreviations MAE, MSE and RMSE, after they have been defined for the first time.

7. Try to be consistent when talking about R-squared. The author sometimes mentioned R-squared and sometimes R^2.

8. In the paragraph before the section ""IV. DATASET ANALYSIS"" , rewrite ""The R squared value ranges between 0 for no-fit and 1 for perfect fit; for example, with a value similar to zero and less than 0.5,
the forecasts have a bad match to the actual values."" as ""The R squared value ranges from 0, corresponding to complete mismatch between the actual and predicted values, to 1, corresponding to the perfect prediction.""

9. What are the percentages (25%, 50% and 75%) in TABLE I? As understood from the paragraph after ""A. Dataset Pre-processing Analysis"", I assume that the are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. If this is the case, then write P25, P50 and P75, or Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively.

10. If point 9. above is valid, please justify the significant discrepancy between the mean and the 50th percentile for ""u0"" and ""c"". This is surprising for me. You just need to comment on this point right after the table.

11. I believe that the max of ""c"" should not be ""1"". Also, the P75 is unusual to be less than the mean.

12. The figure are fine but just drag the last figure and put it before ""References"" and not among them.

6. The scale in fig 5 does not seem to be defined.
7. NOt clear what is the utility of showing the contour plot of the algorithms, and why not ANN?

""Impact of Chatbot on Current Applications"".

The manuscript is missing key components that would typically be included in a more comprehensive analysis. For example, no problem statement, no research question, no references in the introduction or references not related, no specific indication about the survey, no details about the limitations of the technology or potential downsides of using a chatbot like ChatGPT, etc. 
The abstract is missing many components. To structure your abstract it is important to include all components, Introduction, Objective, Methods, Results with a summary of your key findings, and finally
why/how your findings contribute to the fields.

The language used is informal, and lacks specific data or experiments that can support the claims. This makes it hard to ascertain the credibility of the author's claims and the level of accuracy of the information being shared. Proper referencing would be an important component to acknowledge and credit the work of other researchers, and to further enhance the credibility of the author's analysis.
Same problem with the figures, tables, etc.

It is also worth noting that the GPT-3.5 model mentioned in the introduction is not a real model and the author may be referring to some version of GPT-3 that is not official. Besides, the introduction has many missing components. 

The lack of adherence to academic standards and the lack of relevance to the topic of Metaverse, I would recommend rejecting this paper as a source of information. It is important to use credible, well-written and referenced sources when conducting research in any field, and this paper does not meet these standards.

62,6122,1,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) Thank you for submitting your manuscript to the L&T2023. We appreciate the effort that went into conducting the bibliometric analysis of security and privacy in the Metaverse.
The authors used Dimensions database and VOSviewer to analyze the results, and found a total of 3,016 papers on the topic of the Metaverse, with 192 specifically related to security and privacy.

However, I have the following concerns that I hope it could be addressed in the revised manuscript. Addressing these concerns will strengthen the manuscript and help improve its content.

1. The high number of papers on the topic of the Metaverse (3016) seems disproportionate for a relatively new research field. Additionally, figure 2 shows a total of less than 2000 documents, which adds to my concern about the accuracy of the reported number of papers. Also, figure 3, whih is one of the main finding shows no Metaverse nodes.

Could you provide more details on the selection criteria and evaluation process used for the included papers, include any limitations or biases that may have impacted the results. 
I also suggest that you use ""Title"" in your search instead of full data or ""Title and Abstract"" to verify the numbers you presented. In all cases, it is difficult to understand the result without knowing the query used.
The query used needs to be included under section ""Methodology"".

2. It is not clear why the Dimensions database was chosen for the bibliometric analysis. Could you provide more information on the selection of this database and how it compares to other trusted sources such as Scopus and WoS? add it to your manuscript.
Please note that almost half of the documents in the Dimensions database are not associated with any country of affiliation. This may impact the accuracy of some of the results regarding country/affiliation mapping. For more information, you may want to review the following reference: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2020.593494/full. This may provide further context on the potential impact of this on the data and results you presented.

3. As in item #1, it appears that there may be some issue with the data, as there are 3,016 papers found on the topic of the Metaverse, with 192 specifically related to security but no Metaverse nodes are shown 
in Figure 3. There should be an error in figure 3, because the link provided shows different figure, it also show Metaverse applications and industrial metaverse nodes which do not show up in figure 3.

Moreover, it is well know that the most frequently used keywords related to metaverse are virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT), however they do not appear in figure 3. 
Ensuring that all relevant information is accurately represented in the visualization is important. 
Could you double-check and clarify this issue to make sure that all relevant information is included?

4. To ensure the best possible results, we recommend taking a few extra steps to clean up the extracted data before conducting your analysis. This may include verifying that all papers have complete titles and author information, and double-checking that all papers are relevant to your research topic. By taking a little extra time to prepare the data, you can feel confident that your analysis is based on accurate and complete information.

5. It looks like there may be some inconsistencies between Table 1 and the number of documents you found. The total number of documents shown in Table 1 does not match the number you stated (different than 3016 or 192). Moreover the percentages shown do not add up to 100%.
Please review and resolve these issues to ensure that the information in you paper is accurate and consistent. 
Same thing for Table 2.

6. In figure 4, to analyze the country publications, why looking to bibliographic coupling and not co-authorship?  


There are a few other issues with the paper that I noticed.

The authors is using software “VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), this is an old version, you must use VOSviewer version 1.6.18

The literature review section is brief. It would be helpful to have more detail on the main themes and findings of the reviewed papers, as well as any gaps. It would be helpful to have a discussion of the main themes or issues that have been identified in the reviewed papers, and how these may inform future research or practice in the field.

It's important to have clear and well-presented figures in order to effectively convey information and ideas. Improve figures 1, 3, 4

Finally, the paper could benefit from some additional editing to improve the clarity and follow the correct IEEE format.

We hope that addressing these concerns will strengthen the manuscript and help to improve its content. Thank you again for your submission and we look forward to seeing your revised manuscript.

(CONFIDENTIAL REMARKS FOR THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE) I am concerned about the large number of papers (3016) on the topic of the Metaverse in relation to its relatively new status as a research field.

The manuscript has been updated according to the reviewer suggestion by exploring BCI as a way for people to interact with the metaverse. The paper is now upgraded to ACCEPT.
 
---------------------
Previous comments:

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to L&T2023. I appreciate the effort that went into working on EEG Signal based Non-Invasive BCI by using EMD and Machine Learning.

This text is about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), systems that allow people with disabilities to communicate and move through the use of brain signals. The manuscript also mentions using machine learning algorithms to classify and extract features from improved EEG signals in  order to perform tasks through BCIs. 

This text does not seem to be directly related to the concept of the metaverse. In general, there is no inherent connection between the concept of the metaverse and BCIs. However, maybe it is possible that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could be used as a way for people to interact with the metaverse or virtual reality environments. For example, a person might use a BCI to control a virtual avatar in a virtual world or to communicate with other people in the metaverse. However, this is just an idea  and would depend on the specific capabilities and applications of the BCI system presented. 

I suggest to add the metaverse into the manuscript, I understand that this idea may not fit directly with the focus of your paper, but I thought it might be worth considering as a potential future application or direction for research in this area. Also, change the title accordingly.

As of now, the paper is at "" borderline paper"" till the manuscript is updated.

82,7053,2,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The manuscript presents an overview of the comparison between industrial healthcare evolution. The focus is on the use of these in healthcare. The paper is quite rudimentary. The formatting is not up to par and the references leave a lot to be desired. The use of metaverse is discussed in the paper but most of the material under discussion is quite straight-forward such as registration of the patients and service provision. As it stands, this reviewer does not really see the contributions made by this paper as significant at any level. 

There are also a few typos even in the abstract. For instance, “sited” should be “cited”.","Overall evaluation: -1

105,9228,3,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) This paper demonstrated CNN on audio recordings of holy Quraan for 4 readers for recognition and MFCC  for feature extraction aiming for recitation error check. The algorithm architect is well illustrated with sufficient layers. However, the training dataset is considerably small-sized compared to a deep learning algorithm like CNN. it was apparent through the iteration of training using multiple datasets. In addition, it is advised to clarify the tables numbered from 1-4 referring to which reader. The resulting accuracy of 85.5% is promising but this should be included in the conclusion, not a discussion. Kindly consider writing a well-informative conclusion after the CNN training. It is recommended to use a proofreading platform for typos and grammar mistakes.

Thank you for sending the full paper.

This paper discusses the concept of the metaverse. The author mentions that the metaverse is still not fully developed and is being discussed in both online and print media. The paper aims to explore the trends of metaverse entertainment applications and how they will shape the future.

It appears that the paper is following some of the standards of a scientific paper. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved to better align with scientific paper standards. For example, the research methods used in the paper are not clearly described, and the results of the survey are not discussed. 
Also, in teh abstract you should talk abut your actual results, however you said ""A survey will be conducted
for further results ...""

In Fig. 1, either add a ref or make your own picture.

You must follow IEEE format, in particular the reference style.

There is a confusion in teh objective, sometime you talk about the survey, and sometimes you say ""explore more aspects
of the Metavertainment application, and how this
technology is going to shape the future of the entertainment""

Section II and Section III are the same, they should be combined.

The analysis is somehow superficial

An Immersive Space with Mesh for Teams: Feeling present during Online Lectures A case study at the Arab Open University Dammam. 
It is difficult to go deep in the review and take a final decision on the abstract only.
While the topic of online education and the use of virtual spaces is certainly relevant to the conference theme, the proposed research does not seem to be directly related to the metaverse. 
I suggest to clearly indicate the relationship with metaverse as the use of Mesh for Teams and avatars in a virtual space is mentioned in your abstract.

I also noticed that the abstract does not provide enough detail about the specific research question or hypothesis being tested, or the methods that will be used to conduct the study. We encourage you to consider revising and resubmitting your abstract taking into account the conference theme and the need for a clear and well-defined research question and methodology.
