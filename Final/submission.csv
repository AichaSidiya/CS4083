On the other hand, the battery management system provides important functions such as guaranteeing safe operation and informing the user about the battery’s state. Several approaches for estimating the battery state of charge (SoC) have been presented to produce the most effective management system. Machine learning techniques are used to compare prediction accuracy and the region of the convergence curve on testing and training data in this study. In this paper, we proposed the use of machine learning algorithms as a means of predicting the battery cells SoC. The performance of three robust algorithms namely, the Decision Tree, Random Forest and Linear Regression is compared. The performance is measured in terms of the correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE) and its variants. The highest correlation coefficient of 0.9988 is attained for the case of Random Forest."

In the Metaverse, the Internet of Things (IoT) can offer wireless and seamlessly integrated immersive digital experiences. Because the Metaverse's enabling technologies are considered to be energy-hungry, questions have been raised concerning the sustainability of its widespread adoption and development.  Noise contaminates and distorts measurements from IoT-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The sensor node's computations and energy consumption are increased due to the noise in the signal, resulting in the sensor node's shorter lifespan. Therefore, efficient design is required to achieve noise reduction. Finite-impulse response (FIR) filter is commonly employed in IoT-based WSN as a signal pre-processing stage in eliminating noise from the sensor measurements. The multiplication operation's number of adders (logic-operators) and the adder-steps (logic depths) determine the hardware complexities of FIR filters. The multiplier's speed determines the application's speed. The Booth algorithm facilitates quick multiplication using the partial product (PP) row reduction. The coefficients used by R4BR are  ±0,±1 ,±2,±3,and ±4. As a result of the formation of odd multiples ±3, there will be a delay. The adder is required to add  ±1 and ±2 for its calculations. This slowdown the multiplication procedures and reduces the recoding performance. A carry resist adder (CRA) is utilized to reduce the delay due to the generation of odd multiples. CRA was explicitly built to achieve adding of ±2 and  ±1 without carry propagation. Theoretically, it is observed that the CRA minimizes delay to 86.26% compared to carry propagation adder (CPA) approaches. Additionally, compared to a typical R8BR multiplier, the experimental findings indicated delay, area and power reductions of 48.98%, 56.66%, and 31.2%, respectively. Without carry propagating, the CRA does addition faster, with less energy, and occupies less area."

Image Focusing",probably accept,yes,yes,"This paper presents the utilization of polymer and reflective polyester and other flexible films to fabricate deformable rotational mirrors, where the rotation is utilized to help and filter a reflected image impacted by mirror surface impurities. A self-supporting membrane is fabricated using Mylar polyester film, with a diameter of 120mm and a thickness of 1mm. Electromagnetic actuation is used in combination with a magnetic electrode array beneath the mirror membrane to deform the reflective surface and change the location of the focal point. The mechanical properties of the Mylar polyester film are such that the deflection required for focal point position is minimal, thus increasing mirror flexibility and sensitivity when controlled electromagnetically, whilst the fabrication process is simple and potentially low cost. The developed mirror in this paper consists of two similar membranes lying on top of each other, both rotating at equal speeds around the center to ensure electro-magnetic forces used for deflection are spread evenly between each reflective film sector. The developed mirror prototype functionality was successfully demonstrated when used to filter an image using rotational motion and focus an unfocused picture taken by a regular camera. Therefore, the two main features of the developed mirror are: The rotational behaviour of the mirror and its divided surface that give it the ability to filter the impact of surface impurities on the reflected image and the flexibility to concave and change focal point location while in rotation. This design can be implemented on MEMS devices that look to reduce manufacturing costs by dealing with less than perfect reflective surfaces or other example applications that aim to digitize objects (take images) to be used in virtual reality related projects."

Investigations into dataset preparation, feature significance, correlation, and hyperparameter adjustment are conducted. Artificial neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting regression, and decision trees are the machine-learning approaches that have been used to forecast the distribution of hydrogen leaks in the atmosphere. Different error metrics and $R^2$ correlation have been used to assess the prediction accuracy. The RF method was found to be the most effective approach for forecasting the dispersion of hydrogen leaking into the air."

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate two educational approaches used within the clinic: Augmented reality (AR) and traditional educational methods. The objective is to determine which one has a better impact on nutrition knowledge improvement by using the Nutritional Diabetes Knowledge Survey (NKS) score improvement. 
Method: A total of 65 children and adolescent patients with Type 1 Diabetes, aged 10-16 years old, currently receiving healthcare services at the KAMC-CR nutrition diabetes clinic, were invited to choose the type of education for Carbohydrate counting (AR or traditional education method) and complete a diabetes nutrition knowledge survey before the education and after. The Different between scores with a higher percentage indicates better diabetes nutrition knowledge. Associations between NKS score and duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and BMI were also analyzed.
Results: We discovered that the children who participated in the study had an average level of knowledge regarding nutrition knowledge (a mean of 8.98 out of a score of 23). This suggests that diabetic patients require therapeutic education. When the findings of the pre-knowledge questionnaire and the post-knowledge questionnaire were compared, it was discovered that the children learned more about carbohydrate dietary choices by watching AR videos than by using traditional educational methods. Furthermore, the gained information was independent of gender or age. This AR instructional tool has the potential to be a significant therapeutic education tool for diabetic patients.
Conclusion: This study revealed a positive impact of using a digitalized educational method (AR) on the patient’s diabetes nutrition knowledge, specifically in relation to carbohydrate counting."

The Metaverse users who are willing to share their resources can choose a job to process to get the maximum reward. If more than one user chooses the same job, the reward will be divided fairly. The social welfare goal is to maximize the total reward of the users.

A user may define access rights for other users to access the virtual objects created by her/him; which might enable the other users to manipulate the existing virtual object, delete them, or even steal them. For maintaining accountability in the collaborative world, each activity of each user should be maintained against each object. Hence, an activity provenance mechanism is required for a collaborative MR environment, which can be used to identify the culprit. In this paper, a secure activity provenance mechanism for collaborative MR environments is proposed which utilizes blockchain technologies to maintain the integrity of the provenance data. The proposed scheme is implemented on a consortium blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric as a proof of concept. The presented mechanism is also evaluated using metrics throughput and latency and the results confirm that the proposed solution is best suited for maintaining accountability in a collaborative mixed reality network."

This study aimed to create solid-state 3D models of the vertebral segments and test their deformations and stress state under different circumstances.
Methods: 3D finite element computer model of lumbar segments was created and tested for the range of motion and stress patterns generated at the lumbar spine using SOLIDWORKS® Simulation software (https://www.solidworks.com/). The finite-element mesh was developed for this model. It consisted of 52662 elements and 90426 nodes, with 271278 degrees of freedom. Parabolic triangular and tetrad elements with a size of 4.15 mm and a tolerance of 0.2075 mm were utilized. After validation, the model was analyzed under static compression 300N to mimic the vertical position of the body.
Results:  The following average stress levels were determined in the different components of the model during the test: on the upper vertebra - 9.34±0.11 MPa, on the middle - 10.66±0.10 MPa, and the lower - 8.99±0.09 MPa; on the upper intervertebral disc - 0.58±0.01 MPa, and the lower - 0.69±0.01 MPa; on the anterior longitudinal ligament - 0.02±0.001 MPa; on the posterior longitudinal ligament - 0.05±0.001 MPa; on the upper transverse ligaments - 0.01±0.001 MPa, and the lower - 0.04±0.001 MPa; on the interspinous ligaments - 0.02±0.001 MPa, and the supraspinatus - 0.03±0.001 MPa.
Conclusions:  Modeling static compression showed that the maximum stresses were primarily distributed over the vertebral bodies’ cortical bone and extinguished by the trabecular structure and intervertebral discs. Maximal displacements were found in the annulus fibrosus. Solid-state models with a finite-element mesh can be used for biomechanical investigations in vertebral segments. However, more extensive sample studies with different models may be required to compare movement and loading patterns at different lumbar spine structures."

The major goal of this paper is to develop optimized   PID control parameters to improve the performance of the hybrid robot control system. For that purpose, two optimization techniques followed by fine-tuning are proposed and simulated to get the optimized PID parameters. The first proposed optimization method applies the Satin Bowerbird (SB) optimization technique to optimize the PID parameters.  The Crow Search Optimization (CSO) technique is applied to the SB results to improve the algorithm's performance and the PID parameters. The second proposed method applies the Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) technique for the optimization of the PID parameters. The results of both methods are fine-tuned.   Moreover, a Kalman filter is used to improve the outcomes after and before tuning the PID parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed first method is more effective for the optimization methods of the PID controller, and its results outperform the results given by previously published research."

Simply put, the innovative design consists of two electric ducted fans (EDF) that propel air against the direction of fall and thereby maintain balance. If these motors are allowed to move in two degrees of freedom, the EDF motors will propel and reduce weight of the two-wheeler while maintaining stability. To the best of our knowledge, no study has proposed a system that simultaneously provides propulsion and weight reduction along with achieving self balance. The working mechanism of the utilized PID arducopter controller is elucidated which utilizes an IMU sensor and employs a nonlinear complementary filter on the special orthogonal group to determine the lean angles at any instant of time and a feedback loop to maintain the system’s position at the desired upright zero degrees lean angle. Next, the proposed PID controller is first tested on a small scale model to validate the developed concept to achieve self balance by employing EDF motors. After achieving successful results on the small scale model and thereby attaining the step of validation, the proposed concept is tested against a full scale model (motorbike) by designing the mechanical and electrical parts. The methodology is divided into three major steps – mechanical parts design and manufacture, electrical components design and control system design. Furthermore, three mechanisms are designed to control steering, braking and throttle via a remote transmitter receiver control and autonomous control."
